# Javascript - Typescript Projects

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ The projects I upload here are mostly for configuration purposes or small projects in Javascript or Typescript. if you want to try any example in this repo. Please read below.

I hope this repo is helpful and inspirational for you.

Some recommendation
- I recommend that you use Typescript in your project (both client-side and server-side), it would be better for avoiding type errors and easing your development.
- I recommend that you write the test in your project it is so important.

### Client-side frameworks and libraries (Angular, React, Vue, Svelte (that is my favorite) etc.)

#### I choose yarn package manager (maybe sometimes pnpn or npm you can see). you can try with these commands in terminal. ditto for meta frameworks like Analog, Next, Nuxt, Sveltekit

to install packages
```
yarn
```

to start app
```
yarn dev
```


### Server side javascript runtime environment (node, bun, deno) commands. ditto for nest framework

### Node
```
yarn
```
```
yarn dev
```

### Deno
```
deno dev
```

### Bun
```
yarn
```
```
yarn dev
```

### Nest
```
yarn
```
```
yarn start
```

Note: Please check package.json or deno.json to sure
