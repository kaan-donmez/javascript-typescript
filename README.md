# Javascript - Typescript Projects

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ The projects I upload here are mostly for configuration purposes or small projects in Javascript or Typescript. if you want to try any example in this repo. Please read below.

I hope this repo is helpful and inspirational for you.

Some recommendation
- you should use Typescript in your project (both client-side and server-side), it would be better for avoiding type errors and easing your development.
- you should write tests to avoid mistakes.
- you should provide observability to detect mistakes.
- you should know Algorithms, Data structures, and Design Patterns.
- you should know OOP, SOLID, DRY, KISS, etc.
- you should know Architectures like microservice, monolithic, etc.
- the most important thing is to be curious and ask yourself if your implementation is the best one.

### Client-side frameworks and libraries (Angular, React, Vue, Svelte (that is my favorite) etc.)

I choose yarn package manager (maybe sometimes pnpn or npm you can see). you can try with these commands in terminal. ditto for meta frameworks like Analog, Next, Nuxt, Sveltekit

| Command  | Description         |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| yarn     | to install packages |
| yarn dev | to start app        |


### Server side javascript runtime environment (node, bun, deno) commands. ditto for nest framework

<th style="text-align:center">Deno</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Bun</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Nest</th>
